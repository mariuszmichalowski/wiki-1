# Finance

- Don't by stuff you don't really need.
- Sell stuff you don't really need.
- Safe at least 40% each month.

    This one is really drastic and isn't that necessary. The gist is, you should
    save a lot and the compound effect will slowly pickup and by having more you
    will be making more.

- Don't buy new books until you finish reading the ones you have.

I like reading and learning about economics and finance, personal finance especially.
