# Retirement

## Notes

- **[The 4% Rule](https://www.fool.com/retirement/strategies/withdrawal/4-percent-rule/)**
  You can safely withdraw 4% of your savings every year in your retirement and adjust that amount for inflation without risking running out of money.
- **[The Rule of 25](https://www.thebalance.com/multiply-by-twenty-five-rule-retirement-saving-5101329)**
  (Inverse of the 4% rule) The amount of money that you need to retire is 25X your annual expenses. There's also **[The Rule of 300]** which is the same as rule _The Rule of 25_ except for monthly expenses.

---

_Example_: With your monthly spendings being $2,000 you need approximately $600,000 in saving before you retire.
