# Investing

To get up to speed and learn the basics of sane and mindful investing the best sources are [JL Collins](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/), [John Bogle](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy), [Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/), and the likes of them.

## Notes

- [Invest from early age and often, compounding of investment returns magnifies over the long run and difference of a few years can have large impact to your wealth at the time of retirement (or the age at which you can retire).](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Importance_of_saving_early)

> If you invest $6000 at the beginning of each year (the equivalent of $500 per month, but placed at the beginning of the year to facilitate calculations), and start at age 55, assuming 4% annualized nominal return, your balance at age 65 will be about $75,000. If you start at age 40, you will end up with about $260,000. And if you start at age 25 your balance at age 65 will be about $593,000.

- [Never try to time the market](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/US_mutual_fund_performance_studies). Most actively managed funds actually underperform the market and even if you [invested at the worst time](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4164665-worst-investor-ever) you will still end up pretty well.
