## Wallpapers

- [iMac Wallpapers](https://www.arun.is/blog/os9-wallpaper/)

## Terminal

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) - _deprecated_
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) - faster than iTerm2, and I don't need much more than the speed
  - `ctrl+shit+u` to search unicode characters

## Editors

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [Golang](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/)
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

I will have to find alternative to the jetbrains products when my education license ends which I am really
not looking forward to. While I was able to create semi-IDE setup for golang development in Vim I still
find the Goland superior for writing code in larger repositories.
