# Productivity

## Notes

- [Moving/batching all meetings to one day can be helpful. Or no meetings/calls on Thu/Fri as example.](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1387557466179653632)
- [Have a different room for work that’s separate from bedroom and living area. Take walks to break up the day. Turn everything off at 6, and don’t check messages till next day.](https://twitter.com/herrmanndigital/status/1387773860636995592)
- [Manage priorities rather than time.](https://twitter.com/MikeyFox/status/1387699937954119683)
