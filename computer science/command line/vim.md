# Vim

Here's a little cheat sheet of commands that I for whatever reason considered worthy of typing down. Either because I found them useful, neat, or I forgot them one too many times and got tired of googling them.

## Navigating

```jsx
" Up, down, left, righ
k, j, h, l
" Right by word, left by word, end of word
w, b, e
" Begining of line, end of ling
^, $
" Top of screen, middle of screen, bottom of the screen
H, M, L
" Page down, page up
<C+d>, <C+u>
" Begining of sentece, end of sentence
(, )
" Begining of text block, end of text block
{, }
" To occurence of character to the right, places cursor ON the character
f{char}
" To occurence of character to the left, places cursor ON the character
F{char}
" Till occurence of character to the right, places cursor before the character
t{char}
" Till occurence of character to the right to the left, places cursor before the character
T{char}
" Repeat latest f, F, t, T
;
" Repeat latest f, F, t, T in opposite directioin
,
" Go to line
[line]G
" Go to last line in range, doesn't modify the jumplist
:[range]
" Go to {count} percentage in the file
{count}%
```

## Inserting

```jsx
" Append right of the cursor, append at the end of line
a, A
" Insert left of the cursor, insert at the start of the line
i, I
" Open line under, open line above
o, O
```

## Changing text

```jsx
" Change word
cw
" Change line
cc
" Substitute text
s
" Replace character
r
```

## Deleting

```jsx
" Delete one character
x
" Delete something
d[motion]
" Delete line
dd
" Delete to the end of line
D
" Delete to the start of line
d0
" Delete text between quotes
di"
" Delete text between quotes and the quotes too
da"
" Delete paragraph
dip
```

## Undo and redo

To undo your latest action, press `u`, to redo it, press `<C+R>`. There's not much more to the basic usage except except `U` to undo all changes on the current line.

As with anything else in vim, there's of course more powerful version, in this case called *Undo branches*. You can basically undo something, make some changes, but still retain the undo history.

## Copying and Moving Text

Done using `yank` (copy), `delete`, and `put` commands.

```jsx
" yank whole line
yy, Y
" put below, put above
p, P 
```

Moving lines by default can be done by deleting and pasting. Optionally, you can use  [Unimpaired]().

## Commenting

```jsx
" Comment out something
[count]<leader>cn
" Toggle comment (based on first line)
[count]<leader>c<space>
```

## Search and replace

Done by `:substitute` command, also `:s`.

```jsx
" Search and replace on current line
:s/from/to/g
" Search and replace on all lines
:%s/from/to/g
" Ask for confirmation
:s/from/to/gc
```

## Folding

```jsx
" Fold (hide) selected area
zf
" Open (unfold) selected area
zo
```

## Global

`:global` or `:g` executes anything on any line of the buffer.

```jsx
" List all lines with TODO
:g/TODO:/
```

## Split panes

Create a vertical split using `:vsp` and horizontal with `:sp`. You can specify the width (and height) by prefixing the command with a number of lines, e.g. `:50vsp`. To make the opening of new split panes feel more natural you can set

```jsx
set splitbelow
set splitright
```

which will open the panes by default to the right or bottom.

### Navigate between split panes

By default you navigate between panes by `split_number C-w C-w`. This might get slower with more panes so I found this recommendation on stack overflow:

```
" Use ctrl-[hjkl] to select the active split!
nmap <silent> <c-k> :wincmd k<CR>
nmap <silent> <c-j> :wincmd j<CR>
nmap <silent> <c-h> :wincmd h<CR>
nmap <silent> <c-l> :wincmd l<CR>
```

### Split panes manipulation

Resizing

```jsx
"Max out the height of the current split
ctrl + w _
"Max out the width of the current split
ctrl + w |
"Normalize all split sizes, which is very handy when resizing terminal
ctrl + w =
```

Other manipulation

```
"Swap top/bottom or left/right split
Ctrl+W R
"Break out current window into a new tabview
Ctrl+W T
"Close every window in the current tabview but the current one
Ctrl+W o
```

And as with anything else, you can always `:help split`.

## Tabs

`:tabedit filename` to open file `filename` in a new tab. Navigate between tabs using `gt` and `gT`, this also supports tab indexes so for example `3gT` takes you to the third opened tab. You can also use `:tabfirst` and `:tablast` to navigate to first and last tab respectively. Then there's `:tabn` for next tab and `:tabp` for previous tab. If you want to list all open tabs you can use `:tabs`. To close current tab use `:tabclose` and to keep only the current tab and close the rest there's `:tabonly`.

## Indentation

```jsx
" Indent left
<
" Indent right
>
" Autoindent
=
" Autoindent next line based on the current one
:set autoindent
" Smart indentation based on the file, if you have this on, autoindent should be on as well
:set smartindent
" Number of whitespaces to represent indentation
:set shiftwidth=2
```

## Spellchecking

Turn on spell checking `:set spell spelllang=en_us`. To turn on spell check only for local buffer use `:setlocal spell spelllang=en_us`. To turn off spelling use `:set nospell`.

This alone wouldn't be of much help obviously, but Vim provides means to fix misspelled words, a way to tell that certain words are correct and shouldn't be highlighted, and as always an easy way to navigate between misspelled words.

To move to misspelled word use `[s` and `s]`. This is action like any other so you can prefix it with number, etc. To display fix suggestions use `z=`. If you want certain word to be marked as correct use `zg` and to mark a word as wrong use `zw`.

## Letter case manipulation

```jsx
" swap case
g~
" UPPER case
gU
" lower case
gu
```

## Multiple files

TODO

## Recording

TODO

## Marks

TODO

# Plugins

## Surround

[Vim surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) is all about surrounding *things*. Parentheses, brackets, quotes, tags, you name it.

```jsx
" Change surrounding " to '
cs"'
" Surround word with brackets, 'ys' to surround an object, 'iw' inside word object, and what to surround with
ysiw{
```

## Golang

Go language support for vim: [fatih/vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go).

```jsx
" Go to definition/declaration
gd
" Go back
<C+t>
" Rename anything
:GoRename
" Show function callers
:GoCallers
" Show callstack
:GoCallstack
" Implement interface
:GoImpl [receiver] [interface]
" Keyifi struct literals
:GoKeyify
" Fill struct fields
:GoFillStruct
" Create if err != nil return
:GoIfErr
```

## Unimpaired

Useful and cool complementary pairs of mappings, [tpope/vim-unimpaired](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired).

There are mappings which are simply short normal mode aliases for commonly used ex commands. `]q` is :cnext. `[q` is :cprevious. `]a` is :next.  `[b` is :bprevious.  See the documentation for the full set of 20 mappings and mnemonics.  All of them take a count.

There are line-wise mappings. `[<Space>` and `]<Space>` add newlines before and after the cursor line. `[e` and `]e` exchange the current line with the one above or below it.

There are mappings for toggling options. `[os`, `]os`, and `yos` perform `:set spell`, `:set nospell`, and `:set invspell`, respectively.  There's also `l` (`list`), `n` (`number`), `w` (`wrap`), `x` (`cursorline cursorcolumn`), and several others, plus mappings to help alleviate the `set paste` dance.

There are mappings for encoding and decoding. `[x` and `]x` encode and decode XML (and HTML). `[u` and `]u` encode and decode URLs. `[y` and `]y` do C String style escaping.

And in the miscellaneous category, there's `[f` and `]f` to go to the next/previous file in the directory, and `[n` and `]n` to jump betweenSCM conflict markers.

The `.` command works with all operator mappings, and will work with the line-wise mappings as well if you install [repeat.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat).

## Targets

[Targets.vim](https://github.com/wellle/targets.vim) is a Vim plugin that adds various text objects to give you more targets to operate on. It expands on the idea of simple commands like di' (delete inside the single quotes around the cursor) to give you more opportunities to craft powerful commands that can be repeated reliably. One major goal is to handle all corner cases correctly.

## FZF

[fzf.vim](https://dev.to/iggredible/how-to-search-faster-in-vim-with-fzf-vim-36ko) 

# Advanced usage

## Search and replace across multiple files

```jsx
" Find all occurences of pizza, this needs the vim grep command to be set to rigrep
:grep "pizza"
" Quick fix do -> do something for all entries in quickfix list, that's where grep puts the matches
:cfdo %s/pizza/donut/g | update
```
