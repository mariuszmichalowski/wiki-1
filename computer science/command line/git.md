## Resources

- [Git is my buddy: Effective Git as a solo developer](https://mikkel.ca/blog/git-is-my-buddy-effective-solo-developer/)
  - _A branch must do one useful thing_ - throw what you want into `master` but once you can do integration tests and/or have larger issues to work on, try to do it in branches.
  - _Every commit must be independent_ - this goes for non-solo development as well, `master` should be green on any commit
