- [PlanetScale ‚Äì Database for Developers](https://www.planetscale.com/blog/announcing-planetscale-the-database-for-developers), ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27197873)) - seems like a super cool piece of technology, will definitely keep an eye on it üëç
  - MySQL compatible, serverless, encryption at rest and more
  - pretty generous free tier
  - _branching_ - branch is created from the `main` database schema, allows changes and can be later merged into `main`
  - _non-blocking schema changes_ - DB schema can be changed without downtime or locking
